# Simple-Ruby-IRC-Bot
Made this bot as a simple auto-greeter to use for Twitch.TV

## Dependancies
I wrote this bot using ruby-2.7.0.
I have not tested it using any other ruby versions.

This bot also relies on the cinch gem.

install it using:
gem install cinch

It is the framework that we use to automate our IRC input/output.
